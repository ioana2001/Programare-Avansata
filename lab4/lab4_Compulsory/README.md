<li>Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Streets have names and lengths, intersections have names. A street joins two intersections.</li>
<li>Create the streets and the intersections of the problem described in the example. Use streams in order to easily create the intersections.</li>
<li>Create a list of streets, using LinkedList implementation and sort it by the length, using a comparator expressed as a lambda-expression or method reference. Make sure all the objects are comparable.</li>
<li>Create a set of intersections, using a HashSet implementation. Verify the property that a Set does not contain duplicates.</li>
