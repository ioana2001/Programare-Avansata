Homework (2p)
<ul>
<li>Create a class that describes the city.</li>
<li>Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the streets that are longer than a specified value and join at least 3 streets.</li>
<li>Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for intersections and streets.</li>
<li>Note: A personal implementation of the algorithm will be will be scored extra (+1p).</li>
</ul>

Bonus (2p)
<ul>
<li>The city hall wants to regularly inspect the surveillance cameras, sending a maintenance car to go through it all.</li>
<li>Implement an algorithm that determines the route of the maintenance car, in order to minimize the total length. The algorithm must run fast and should not find a solution that is twice as bad than the optimum route.</li>
<li>Create a random problem generator, making sure that the lengths between intersections satisfy the triangle inequality.</li>
</ul>
