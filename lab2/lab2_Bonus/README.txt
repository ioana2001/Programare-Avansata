Class SolutionDSatur has a method colorDSatur that uses an algorithm for assigning each event a room. Each node represents an event and an edge between two nodes means that they are conflicting. After we color the graph we can consider each color a room and assign the events in rooms accordingly.

Method testingTime from class Main is used for comparing the time between Greedy and DSatur. You can input the size of the instance you want to generate.

Bonus (2p)

Use the time package in order to describe the start and the end time of the events.
Implement the DSatur graph coloring algorithm.
Generate large random instances and:
compare the solutions generated by Greedy and DSatur algorithms;
analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption). Identify the hot-spots in your code.
